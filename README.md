Keep trying to kill the bot, but eventually it will get you. Get points for every bot assassinated! No points for running away.

Features
--------

 - Play on a fantastical custom map (created using TILED) or the original GRITS map
  - Featuring open license art from [Daniel Eddeland][5] (CC-BY-SA 3.0)
 - Using the [GRITS engine][6] without the need to connect to a server (Apache license)
 - Intense circling Artificial Intelligence!
 - [Bootstrap][7] enabled button shininess (Apache license)
 - Original music created using [Otomata][8] and Audacity
 - Original sound effects created using [bfxr][9]

The Code
------------

Future plans
------------
 - Modularize the ability to spawn bots into the game and add it back into the full GRITS codebase, essentially adding AI-controlled units to the existing GRITS game.
 - Create a separate single-player game with a fantasy emphasis, continuing the conversion
  - Replace the robotic characters with elves
  - Potions instead of repair kits
  - Swords instead of machine guns
 - Modularize the single-player game so that new games can be made easily without touching any of the base code

*An HTML5 game for the Udacity HTML5 Game Dev Class Contest, April 2013.*
